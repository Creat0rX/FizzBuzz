# FizzBuzz

The FizzBuzz problem is simple. Given a list of numbers from 1 to 100, the program should:

- print ``Fizz`` if the number is divisible by 3.
- print ``Buzz`` if the number is divisible by 5.
- print ``FizzBuzz`` if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5.
- print the number itself if it is not divisible by 3 or 5.

All 100 results must each be printed on a line of its own.

## Results

In this repository, the FizzBuzz problem was completed by myself in 10 different programming languages.
Here are the methods in which they can be run from the terminal inside the directory:

- C: ``gcc fizzbuzz.c; ./a.out``
- C++: ``g++ fizzbuzz.cpp; ./a.out``
- GoLang: ``go run fizzbuzz.go``
- Java: ``java fizzbuzz.java``
- JavaScript: ``node fizzbuzz.js``
- PHP: ``php fizzbuzz.php``
- Python: ``python fizzbuzz.py`` OR ``python3 fizzbuzz.py`` (depending on the version of python being used)
- Ruby: ``ruby fizzbuzz.rb``
- Rust: ``rustc fizzbuzz.rs; ./fizzbuzz``
- Bash: ``bash fizzbuzz.sh``
